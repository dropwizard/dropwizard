  # The type of connector to use. Other valid values are "nonblocking" or "legacy". In general, the
  # blocking connector should be used for low-latency services with short request durations. The
  # nonblocking connector should be used for services with long request durations or which
  # specifically take advantage of Jetty's continuation support.
  # If you need SSL support, you can either choose from "nonblocking+ssl" or "legacy+ssl".
