.. note:: Upgrading to 0.6.0 will require changing your code. First, your ``Service`` subclass will
          need to implement both ``#initialize(Bootstrap<T>)`` **and**
          ``#run(T, Environment)``. What used to be in ``initialize`` should be moved to ``run``.
          Second, your representation classes need to be migrated to Jackson 2. For the most part,
          this is just changing imports to ``com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.*``, but there are
          `some subtler changes in functionality <http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonUpgradeFrom19To20>`_.
          Finally, references to 0.5.x's ``Json``, ``JerseyClient``, or ``JDBI`` classes should be
          changed to Jackon's ``ObjectMapper``, Jersey's ``Client``, and JDBI's ``DBI``
          respectively.

* Upgraded to Guava 13.0 final.
* Fixed task path bugs.
* Upgraded to Metrics 2.1.3.
* Added ``JerseyClientConfiguration#compressRequestEntity`` for disabling the compression of request
  entities.
* Added ``Environment#scanPackagesForResourcesAndProviders`` for automatically detecting Jersey

.. _rel-0.3.1:

v0.3.1: Mar 15 2012
===================

* Fixed debug logging levels for ``Log``.

.. _rel-0.3.0:

v0.3.0: Mar 13 2012
===================

* Upgraded to JDBI 2.31.3.
* Upgraded to Jackson 1.9.5.
* Upgraded to Jetty 8.1.2. (Jetty 9 is now the experimental branch. Jetty 8 is just Jetty 7 with
  Servlet 3.0 support.)
* Dropped ``dropwizard-templates`` and added ``dropwizard-views`` instead.
* Added ``AbstractParam#getMediaType()``.
* Fixed potential encoding bug in parsing YAML files.
* Fixed a ``NullPointerException`` when getting logging levels via JMX.
* Dropped support for ``@BearerToken`` and added ``dropwizard-auth`` instead.
* Added ``@CacheControl`` for resource methods.
* Added ``AbstractService#getJson()`` for full Jackson customization.
* Fixed formatting of configuration file parsing errors.
* ``ThreadNameFilter`` is now added by default. The thread names Jetty worker threads are set to the
  method and URI of the HTTP request they are currently processing.
* Added command-line overriding of configuration parameters via system properties. For example,
  ``-Ddw.http.port=8090`` will override the configuration file to set ``http.port`` to ``8090``.
* Removed ``ManagedCommand``. It was rarely used and confusing.
* If ``http.adminPort`` is the same as ``http.port``, the admin servlet will be hosted under
  ``/admin``. This allows Dropwizard applications to be deployed to environments like Heroku, which
  require applications to open a single port.
* Added ``http.adminUsername`` and ``http.adminPassword`` to allow for Basic HTTP Authentication
  for the admin servlet.
* Upgraded to `Metrics 2.1.1 <http://metrics.codahale.com/about/release-notes/#v2-1-1-mar-13-2012>`_.

.. _rel-0.2.1:

v0.2.1: Feb 24 2012
===================

* Added ``logging.console.timeZone`` and ``logging.file.timeZone`` to control the time zone of
  the timestamps in the logs. Defaults to UTC.
* Upgraded to Jetty 7.6.1.
* Upgraded to Jersey 1.12.
* Upgraded to Guava 11.0.2.
* Upgraded to SnakeYAML 1.10.
* Upgraded to tomcat-dbcp 7.0.26.
* Upgraded to Metrics 2.0.3.

.. _rel-0.2.0:

v0.2.0: Feb 15 2012
===================

* Switched to using ``jackson-datatype-guava`` for JSON serialization/deserialization of Guava
  types.
* Use ``InstrumentedQueuedThreadPool`` from ``metrics-jetty``.
* Upgraded to Jackson 1.9.4.
* Upgraded to Jetty 7.6.0 final.
* Upgraded to tomcat-dbcp 7.0.25.
* Improved fool-proofing for ``Service`` vs. ``ScalaService``.
* Switched to using Jackson for configuration file parsing. SnakeYAML is used to parse YAML
  configuration files to a JSON intermediary form, then Jackson is used to map that to your
  ``Configuration`` subclass and its fields. Configuration files which don't end in ``.yaml`` or
  ``.yml`` are treated as JSON.
* Rewrote ``Json`` to no longer be a singleton.
* Converted ``JsonHelpers`` in ``dropwizard-testing`` to use normalized JSON strings to compare
  JSON.
* Collapsed ``DatabaseConfiguration``. It's no longer a map of connection names to configuration
  objects.
* Changed ``Database`` to use the validation query in ``DatabaseConfiguration`` for its ``#ping()``
  method.
* Changed many ``HttpConfiguration`` defaults to match Jetty's defaults.
* Upgraded to JDBI 2.31.2.
* Fixed JAR locations in the CLI usage screens.
* Upgraded to Metrics 2.0.2.

===================

* Upgraded to Guava 11.0.1.

* Switched to using the instrumented connectors from ``metrics-jetty``. This allows for much
  lower-level metrics about your service, including whether or not your thread pools are overloaded.
* Added FindBugs to the build process.
* Added ``ResourceTest`` to ``dropwizard-testing``, which uses the Jersey Test Framework to provide
  full testing of resources.
* Upgraded to Jetty 7.6.0.RC4.
* Decoupled URIs and resource paths in ``AssetServlet`` and ``AssetsBundle``.
* Added ``rootPath`` to ``Configuration``. It allows you to serve Jersey assets off a specific path
  (e.g., ``/resources/*`` vs ``/*``).
* ``AssetServlet`` now looks for ``index.htm`` when handling requests for the root URI.
* Upgraded to Metrics 2.0.0-RC0.

.. _rel-0.1.2:

v0.1.2: Jan 07 2012
===================
