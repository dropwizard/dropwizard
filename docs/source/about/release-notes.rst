.. _rel-0.7.1:

v0.7.1: Jun 18 2014
===================

* Added instrumentation to ``Task``, using metrics annotations.
* Added ability to blacklist SSL cipher suites.
* Added ``@PATCH`` annotation for Jersey resource methods to indicate use of the HTTP ``PATCH`` method.
* Added support for configurable request retry behavior for ``HttpClientBuilder`` and ``JerseyClientBuilder``.
* Added facility to get the admin HTTP port in ``DropwizardAppTestRule``.
* Added ``ScanningHibernateBundle``, which scans packages for entities, instead of requiring you to add them individually.
* Added facility to invalidate credentials from the ``CachingAuthenticator`` that match a specified ``Predicate``.
* Added a CI build profile for JDK 8 to ensure that Dropwizard builds against the latest version of the JDK.
* Added ``--catalog`` and ``--schema`` options to Liquibase.
* Added ``stackTracePrefix`` configuration option to ``SyslogAppenderFactory`` to configure the pattern prepended to each line in the stack-trace sent to syslog. Defaults to the TAB character, "\t". Note: this is different from the bang prepended to text logs (such as "console", and "file"), as syslog has different conventions for multi-line messages.
* Added ability to validate ``Optional`` values using validation annotations. Such values require the ``@UnwrapValidatedValue`` annotation, in addition to the validations you wish to use.
* Added facility to configure the ``User-Agent`` for ``HttpClient``. Configurable via the ``userAgent`` configuration option.
* Added configurable ``AllowedMethodsFilter``. Configure allowed HTTP methods for both the application and admin connectors with ``allowedMethods``.
* Added support for specifying a ``CredentialProvider`` for HTTP clients.
* Fixed silently overriding Servlets or ServletFilters; registering a duplicate will now emit a warning.
* Fixed ``SyslogAppenderFactory`` failing when the application name contains a PCRE reserved character (e.g. ``/`` or ``$``).
* Fixed regression causing JMX reporting of metrics to not be enabled by default.
* Fixed transitive dependencies on log4j and extraneous sl4j backends bleeding in to projects. Dropwizard will now enforce that only Logback and slf4j-logback are used everywhere.
* Fixed clients disconnecting before the request has been fully received causing a "500 Internal Server Error" to be generated for the request log. Such situations will now correctly generate a "400 Bad Request", as the request is malformed. Clients will never see these responses, but they matter for logging and metrics that were previously considering this situation as a server error.
* Fixed ``DiscoverableSubtypeResolver`` using the system ``ClassLoader``, instead of the local one.
* Fixed regression causing Liquibase ``--dump`` to fail to dump the database.
* Fixed the CSV metrics reporter failing when the output directory doesn't exist. It will now attempt to create the directory on startup.
* Fixed global frequency for metrics reporters being permanently overridden by the default frequency for individual reporters.
* Fixed tests failing on Windows due to platform-specific line separators.
* Changed ``DropwizardAppTestRule`` so that it no longer requires a configuration path to operate. When no path is specified, it will now use the applications' default configuration.
* Changed ``Bootstrap`` so that ``getMetricsFactory()`` may now be overridden to provide a custom instance to the framework to use.
* Upgraded to Guava 17.0
  Note: this addresses a bug with BloomFilters that is incompatible with pre-17.0 BloomFilters.
* Upgraded to Jackson 2.3.3
* Upgraded to Apache HttpClient 4.3.4

.. _rel-0.7.0:

v0.7.0: Apr 04 2014
===================

* Upgraded to Java 7.
* Moved to the ``io.dropwizard`` group ID and namespace.
* Extracted out a number of reusable libraries: ``dropwizard-configuration``,
  ``dropwizard-jackson``, ``dropwizard-jersey``, ``dropwizard-jetty``, ``dropwizard-lifecycle``,
  ``dropwizard-logging``, ``dropwizard-servlets``, ``dropwizard-util``, ``dropwizard-validation``.
* Extracted out various elements of ``Environment`` to separate classes: ``JerseyEnvironment``,
  ``LifecycleEnvironment``, etc.
* Extracted out ``dropwizard-views-freemarker`` and ``dropwizard-views-mustache``.
  ``dropwizard-views`` just provides infrastructure now.
* Renamed ``Service`` to ``Application``.
* Added ``dropwizard-forms``, which provides support for multipart MIME entities.
* Added ``dropwizard-spdy``.
* Added ``AppenderFactory``, allowing for arbitrary logging appenders for application and request
  logs.
* Added ``ConnectorFactory``, allowing for arbitrary Jetty connectors.
* Added ``ServerFactory``, with multi- and single-connector implementations.
* Added ``ReporterFactory``, for metrics reporters, with Graphite and Ganglia implementations.
* Added ``ConfigurationSourceProvider`` to allow loading configuration files from sources other than
  the filesystem.
* Added setuid support. Configure the user/group to run as and soft/hard open file limits in the
  ``ServerFactory``. To bind to privileged ports (e.g. 80), enable ``startsAsRoot`` and set ``user``
  and ``group``, then start your application as the root user.
* Added builders for managed executors.
* Added a default ``check`` command, which loads and validates the service configuration.
* Added support for the Jersey HTTP client to ``dropwizard-client``.
* Added Jackson Afterburner support.
* Added support for ``deflate``-encoded requests and responses.
* Added support for HTTP Sessions. Add the annotated parameter to your resource method:
  ``@Session HttpSession session`` to have the session context injected.
* Added support for a "flash" message to be propagated across requests. Add the annotated parameter
  to your resource method: ``@Session Flash message`` to have any existing flash message injected.
* Added support for deserializing Java ``enums`` with fuzzy matching rules (i.e., whitespace
  stripping, ``-``/``_`` equivalence, case insensitivity, etc.).
* Added ``HibernateBundle#configure(Configuration)`` for customization of Hibernate configuration.
* Added support for Joda Time ``DateTime`` arguments and results when using JDBI.
* Added configuration option to include Exception stack-traces when logging to syslog. Stack traces
  are now excluded by default.
* Added the application name and PID (if detectable) to the beginning of syslog messages, as is the
  convention.
* Added ``--migrations`` command-line option to ``migrate`` command to supply the migrations
  file explicitly.
* Validation errors are now returned as ``application/json`` responses.
* Simplified ``AsyncRequestLog``; now standardized on Jetty 9 NCSA format.
* Renamed ``DatabaseConfiguration`` to ``DataSourceFactory``, and ``ConfigurationStrategy`` to
  ``DatabaseConfiguration``.
* Changed logging to be asynchronous. Messages are now buffered and batched in-memory before being
  delivered to the configured appender(s).
* Changed handling of runtime configuration errors. Will no longer display an Exception stack-trace
  and will present a more useful description of the problem, including suggestions when appropriate.
* Changed error handling to depend more heavily on Jersey exception mapping.
* Changed ``dropwizard-db`` to use ``tomcat-jdbc`` instead of ``tomcat-dbcp``.
* Changed default formatting when logging nested Exceptions to display the root-cause first.
* Replaced ``ResourceTest`` with ``ResourceTestRule``, a JUnit ``TestRule``.
* Dropped Scala support.
* Dropped ``ManagedSessionFactory``.
* Dropped ``ObjectMapperFactory``; use ``ObjectMapper`` instead.

.. note:: Upgrading to 0.6.0 will require changing your code. First, your ``Service`` subclass will
          need to implement both ``#initialize(Bootstrap<T>)`` **and**
          ``#run(T, Environment)``. What used to be in ``initialize`` should be moved to ``run``.
          Second, your representation classes need to be migrated to Jackson 2. For the most part,
          this is just changing imports to ``com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.*``, but there are
          `some subtler changes in functionality <http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonUpgradeFrom19To20>`_.
          Finally, references to 0.5.x's ``Json``, ``JerseyClient``, or ``JDBI`` classes should be
          changed to Jackon's ``ObjectMapper``, Jersey's ``Client``, and JDBI's ``DBI``
          respectively.

.. _rel-0.5.1:

* Fixed task path bugs.
* Upgraded to Metrics 2.1.3.
* Added ``JerseyClientConfiguration#compressRequestEntity`` for disabling the compression of request
  entities.
* Added ``Environment#scanPackagesForResourcesAndProviders`` for automatically detecting Jersey
  providers and resources.

.. _rel-0.3.1:

v0.3.1: Mar 15 2012
===================

* Fixed debug logging levels for ``Log``.

.. _rel-0.3.0:

v0.3.0: Mar 13 2012
===================

* Upgraded to JDBI 2.31.3.
* Upgraded to Jackson 1.9.5.
* Upgraded to Jetty 8.1.2. (Jetty 9 is now the experimental branch. Jetty 8 is just Jetty 7 with
  Servlet 3.0 support.)
* Dropped ``dropwizard-templates`` and added ``dropwizard-views`` instead.
* Added ``AbstractParam#getMediaType()``.
* Fixed potential encoding bug in parsing YAML files.
* Fixed a ``NullPointerException`` when getting logging levels via JMX.
* Dropped support for ``@BearerToken`` and added ``dropwizard-auth`` instead.
* Added ``@CacheControl`` for resource methods.

  method and URI of the HTTP request they are currently processing.
* Added command-line overriding of configuration parameters via system properties. For example,
  ``-Ddw.http.port=8090`` will override the configuration file to set ``http.port`` to ``8090``.
* Removed ``ManagedCommand``. It was rarely used and confusing.
* If ``http.adminPort`` is the same as ``http.port``, the admin servlet will be hosted under
  ``/admin``. This allows Dropwizard applications to be deployed to environments like Heroku, which
  require applications to open a single port.
* Added ``http.adminUsername`` and ``http.adminPassword`` to allow for Basic HTTP Authentication
  for the admin servlet.
* Upgraded to `Metrics 2.1.1 <http://metrics.codahale.com/about/release-notes/#v2-1-1-mar-13-2012>`_.

.. _rel-0.2.1:

* Upgraded to Jackson 1.9.4.
* Upgraded to Jetty 7.6.0 final.
* Upgraded to tomcat-dbcp 7.0.25.
* Improved fool-proofing for ``Service`` vs. ``ScalaService``.
* Switched to using Jackson for configuration file parsing. SnakeYAML is used to parse YAML
  configuration files to a JSON intermediary form, then Jackson is used to map that to your
  ``Configuration`` subclass and its fields. Configuration files which don't end in ``.yaml`` or
  ``.yml`` are treated as JSON.
* Rewrote ``Json`` to no longer be a singleton.
* Converted ``JsonHelpers`` in ``dropwizard-testing`` to use normalized JSON strings to compare
  JSON.
* Collapsed ``DatabaseConfiguration``. It's no longer a map of connection names to configuration
  objects.
* Changed ``Database`` to use the validation query in ``DatabaseConfiguration`` for its ``#ping()``
  method.

  full testing of resources.
* Upgraded to Jetty 7.6.0.RC4.
* Decoupled URIs and resource paths in ``AssetServlet`` and ``AssetsBundle``.
* Added ``rootPath`` to ``Configuration``. It allows you to serve Jersey assets off a specific path
  (e.g., ``/resources/*`` vs ``/*``).
* ``AssetServlet`` now looks for ``index.htm`` when handling requests for the root URI.
* Upgraded to Metrics 2.0.0-RC0.

.. _rel-0.1.2:

v0.1.2: Jan 07 2012
===================
