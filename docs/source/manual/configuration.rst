.. _man-configuration-requestLog:

Request Log
...........

The new request log uses the `logback-access`_ library for processing request logs, which allow to use an extended set
of logging patterns. See the `logback-access-pattern`_ docs for the reference.

.. code-block:: yaml

    server:
      requestLog:
        appenders:
          - type: console

Classic Request Log
...................

The classic request log uses the `logback-classic`_ library for processing request logs. It produces logs only in the
standard `NCSA common log format`_, but allows to use an extended set of appenders.

.. code-block:: yaml

    server:
      requestLog:

        timeZone: UTC
        appenders:

port                     8080                The TCP/IP port on which to listen for incoming connections.
bindHost                 (none)              The hostname to bind to.
inheritChannel           false               Whether this connector uses a channel inherited from the JVM.
                                             Use it with `Server::Starter`_, to launch an instance of Jetty on demand.
headerCacheSize          512 bytes           The size of the header field cache.
outputBufferSize         32KiB               The size of the buffer into which response content is aggregated before being sent to
                                             the client. A larger buffer can improve performance by allowing a content producer
                                             to run without blocking, however larger buffers consume more memory and may induce
                                             some latency before a client starts processing the content.
maxRequestHeaderSize     8KiB                The maximum size of a request header. Larger headers will allow for more and/or
                                             larger cookies plus larger form content encoded  in a URL. However, larger headers
                                             consume more memory and can make a server more vulnerable to denial of service
                                             attacks.
maxResponseHeaderSize    8KiB                The maximum size of a response header. Larger headers will allow for more and/or
                                             larger cookies and longer HTTP headers (eg for redirection).  However, larger headers
                                             will also consume more memory.
inputBufferSize          8KiB                The size of the per-connection input buffer.
idleTimeout              30 seconds          The maximum idle time for a connection, which roughly translates to the
                                             `java.net.Socket#setSoTimeout(int)`_ call, although with NIO implementations
                                             other mechanisms may be used to implement the timeout.
                                             The max idle time is applied when waiting for a new message to be received on a connection
                                             or when waiting for a new message to be sent on a connection.
                                             This value is interpreted as the maximum time between some progress being made on the
                                             connection. So if a single byte is read or written, then the timeout is reset.
blockingTimeout          (none)              The timeout applied to blocking operations. This timeout is in addition to
                                             the `idleTimeout`, and applies to the total operation (as opposed to the
                                             idle timeout that applies to the time no data is being sent).
minBufferPoolSize        64 bytes            The minimum size of the buffer pool.
bufferPoolIncrement      1KiB                The increment by which the buffer pool should be increased.
maxBufferPoolSize        64KiB               The maximum size of the buffer pool.
acceptorThreads          (Jetty's default)   The number of worker threads dedicated to accepting connections.
                                             By default is *max(1, min(4, #CPUs/8))*.
selectorThreads          (Jetty's default)   The number of worker threads dedicated to sending and receiving data.
                                             By default is *max(1, min(4, #CPUs/2))*.
acceptQueueSize          (OS default)        The size of the TCP/IP accept queue for the listening socket.
reuseAddress             true                Whether or not ``SO_REUSEADDR`` is enabled on the listening socket.
soLingerTime             (disabled)          Enable/disable ``SO_LINGER`` with the specified linger time.
useServerHeader          false               Whether or not to add the ``Server`` header to each response.
useDateHeader            true                Whether or not to add the ``Date`` header to each response.
useForwardedHeaders      true                Whether or not to look at ``X-Forwarded-*`` headers added by proxies. See
                                             `ForwardedRequestCustomizer`_ for details.
httpCompliance           RFC7230             This sets the http compliance level used by Jetty when parsing http, this
                                             can be useful when using a non-RFC7230 compliant front end, such as nginx,
                                             which can produce multi-line headers when forwarding client certificates
                                             using ``proxy_set_header X-SSL-CERT $ssl_client_cert;``
                                             Possible values are set forth in the ``org.eclipse.jetty.http.HttpCompliance``
                                             enum:

                                             * RFC7230: Disallow header folding.
                                             * RFC2616: Allow header folding.

HTTP/2 over TLS
---------------

HTTP/2 is a new protocol, intended as a successor of HTTP/1.1. It adds several important features
like binary structure, stream multiplexing over a single connection, header compression, and server push.
At the same time it remains semantically compatible with HTTP/1.1, which should make the upgrade process more
seamless. Checkout HTTP/2 FAQ__ for the further information.

.. __: https://http2.github.io/faq/

For an encrypted connection HTTP/2 uses ALPN protocol. It's a TLS extension, that allows a client to negotiate
a protocol to use after the handshake is complete. If either side does not support ALPN, then the protocol will
be ignored, and an HTTP/1.1 connection over TLS will be used instead.

For this connector to work with ALPN protocol you need to provide alpn-boot library to JVM's bootpath.
The correct library version depends on a JVM version. Consult Jetty ALPN guide__ for the reference.

.. __: http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/alpn-chapter.html

Note that your JVM also must provide ``TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`` cipher. The specification states__
that HTTP/2 deployments must support it to avoid handshake failures. It's the single supported cipher in HTTP/2
connector by default.

HTTP/2 Plain Text
-----------------

HTTP/2 promotes using encryption, but doesn't require it. However, most browsers stated that they will
not support HTTP/2 without encryption. Currently no browser supports HTTP/2 unencrypted.

The connector should only be used in closed secured networks or during development. It expects from clients
an HTTP/1.1 OPTIONS request with ``Upgrade : h2c`` header to indicate a wish to upgrade to HTTP/2, or a request with
the HTTP/2 connection preface. If the client doesn't support HTTP/2, a plain HTTP/1.1 connections will be used instead.

The metrics configuration has two fields; frequency and reporters.

.. code-block:: yaml

    metrics:
      frequency: 1 minute
      reporters:
        - type: <type>


====================== ===========  ===========
Name                   Default      Description
====================== ===========  ===========
frequency              1 minute     The frequency to report metrics. Overridable per-reporter.
reporters              (none)       A list of reporters to report metrics.
====================== ===========  ===========


.. _man-configuration-metrics-all:

All Reporters
-------------

The following options are available for all metrics reporters.

.. code-block:: yaml

    metrics:
      reporters:
        - type: <type>
          durationUnit: milliseconds
          rateUnit: seconds
          excludes: (none)
          includes: (all)
          useRegexFilters: false
          frequency: 1 minute


====================== =============  ===========
Name                   Default        Description
====================== =============  ===========
durationUnit           milliseconds   The unit to report durations as. Overrides per-metric duration units.
rateUnit               seconds        The unit to report rates as. Overrides per-metric rate units.
excludes               (none)         Metrics to exclude from reports, by name. When defined, matching metrics will not be reported.
includes               (all)          Metrics to include in reports, by name. When defined, only these metrics will be reported.
useRegexFilters        false          Indicates whether the values of the 'includes' and 'excludes' fields should be treated as regular expressions or not.
frequency              (none)         The frequency to report metrics. Overrides the default.
====================== =============  ===========

The inclusion and exclusion rules are defined as:

* If **includes** is empty, then all metrics are included;
* If **includes** is not empty, only metrics from this list are included;
* If **excludes** is empty, no metrics are excluded;
* If **excludes** is not empty, then exclusion rules take precedence over inclusion rules. Thus if a name matches the exclusion rules it will not be included in reports even if it also matches the inclusion rules.

Polymorphic configuration
=========================

.. rubric:: The ``dropwizard-configuration`` module provides you with a polymorphic configuration
            mechanism, meaning that a particular section of your configuration file can be implemented
            using one or more configuration classes.

To use this capability for your own configuration classes, create a top-level configuration interface or class that
implements ``Discoverable`` and add the name of that class to ``META-INF/services/io.dropwizard.jackson.Discoverable``.
Make sure to use `Jackson polymorphic deserialization`_ annotations appropriately.

.. _Jackson polymorphic deserialization: http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonPolymorphicDeserialization

.. code-block:: java

    @JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.NAME, include = As.PROPERTY, property = "type")
    interface WidgetFactory extends Discoverable {
        Widget createWidget();
    }

Then create subtypes of the top-level type corresponding to each alternative, and add their names to
``META-INF/services/WidgetFactory``.

.. code-block:: java

    @JsonTypeName("hammer")
    public class HammerFactory implements WidgetFactory {
        @JsonProperty
        private int weight = 10;

        @Override
        public Hammer createWidget() {
            return new Hammer(weight);
        }
    }

    @JsonTypeName("chisel")
    public class ChiselFactory implements WidgetFactory {
        @JsonProperty
        private float radius = 1;

        @Override
        public Chisel createWidget() {
            return new Chisel(radius);
        }
    }

Now you can use ``WidgetFactory`` objects in your application's configuration.

.. code-block:: java

    public class MyConfiguration extends Configuration {
        @JsonProperty
        @NotNull
        @Valid
        private List<WidgetFactory> widgets;
    }

.. code-block:: yaml

    widgets:
      - type: hammer
        weight: 20
      - type: chisel
        radius: 0.4

See :ref:`testing configurations <man-testing-configurations>` for details on ensuring the
configuration will be deserialized correctly.
