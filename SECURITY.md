# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

In general, the currently stable and the previously stable major & minor versions are supported.

For example, Dropwizard 4.0.x will receive critical security fixes while Dropwizard 4.1.x is the current stable version.

Once Dropwizard 4.2.x has been released, Dropwizard 4.0.x will be unsupported and Dropwizard 4.1.x will only receive critical security fixes.
