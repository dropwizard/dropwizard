*Dropwizard is a sneaky way of making fast Java web applications.*

It's a little bit of opinionated glue code which bangs together a set of libraries which have
historically not sucked:

* [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) for HTTP servin'.
* [Jersey](https://jersey.github.io/) for REST modelin'.
* [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) for JSON parsin' and generatin'.
* [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) for loggin'.
* [Hibernate Validator](http://hibernate.org/validator/) for validatin'.
* [Metrics](http://metrics.dropwizard.io) for figurin' out what your application is doin' in production.
* [JDBI](http://www.jdbi.org) and [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/orm/) for databasin'.
* [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/) for migratin'.
